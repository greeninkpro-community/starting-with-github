# Starting-with-github

1. **Check if Git is installed:** 🛠️
   - Open your terminal and type `git --version`. If it returns a git version, then Git is installed. If not, download and install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Configuring Git:** ⚙️
   - Set up your global config values using the following commands, replacing the placeholders with your information:
     ```
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "email@something.com"
     ```

3. **Create a GitHub account:** 🌐
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up if you haven't already.

4. **Setting up SSH keys:** 🔑
   - Open your terminal and navigate to your home directory (`cd ~`).
   - Check if the `.ssh` directory exists by typing `ls -a`. If it doesn't exist, create it with `mkdir ~/.ssh`.
   - Generate an SSH key pair using the command:
     ```
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
     Press Enter for the file to save the key, and optionally set a passphrase.
   - Start the SSH agent with:
     ```
     eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
     ```
   - Add your SSH key to the SSH agent:
     ```
     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     ```

5. **Adding SSH key to your GitHub account:** 🚪
   - Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.1/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your SSH public key to your GitHub account.

6. **Fork and cloning the repository:** 📥
   - Fork the repository [starting-with-github](https://github.com/greeninkpro-community/starting-with-github) to your GitHub account like (`starting-with-github-<username>`).
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using either SSH or HTTPS option. For SSH, use `git clone git@github.com:<username>/starting-with-github.git` and for HTTPS, use `git clone https://github.com/<username>/starting-with-github.git`.
   

7. **Working on the assignment:** 📝
   - Change directory into the cloned repository folder (`cd starting-with-github-<username>`).
   - Initialise the repo with `git init`.
   - Create a new branch called `develop` with `git checkout -b develop`.
   - Create a directory with your full name inside the root of the app (e.g., `steve_jobs`) and change directory into it.
   - Create another directory inside your directory above created called `things_i_will_learn`.
   - Inside the `things_i_will_learn` directory, create two text files: `tech.txt` and add whatever things you wish to learn then commit the file.
   - Now create another file `habit.txt`, and add whatever things you want do habitually into them.
   - Stage and commit your changes.

8. **Managing branches and commits:** 🔄
   - But now you remember to add more tech stacks unstage the `tech.txt`, you can unstage it with `git reset HEAD -- <filename>`.
   - Checkout to the `main` branch (`git checkout main`), then create a new branch called `tech` (`git checkout -b tech`).
   - Make the specified changes to `tech.txt` and commit them to the `tech` branch.
   - Merge the `tech` branch into the `develop` branch:
     ```
     git checkout develop
     git merge tech
     ```
   - Check the log to see the changes you've made so far (`git log`).
   - Commit your changes.

9. **Pushing changes and raising a Pull Request:** 🚀
   - Push your changes to your forked repository (`git push origin develop`).
   - Once pushed, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Open a Pull Request from your `develop` branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
   - Give your Pull Request a meaningful title and description, then submit it.

10. **Merging changes:** 🔄
    - Once your Pull Request is reviewed and approved, you can merge the changes into the main branch of the original repository.

Congratulations! You've completed the basic Git & GitHub workflow assignment. If you encounter any ambiguity, feel free to seek clarification or further assistance. 🎉
